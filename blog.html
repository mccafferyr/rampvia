  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>When most people think about air travel, their minds immediately go to pilots, aircraft, and air traffic control. But behind every flight, Ground Support Equipment (GSE) plays a critical role in ensuring operations run safely, efficiently, and on schedule.</p>

  <h2>What Is Ground Support Equipment (GSE)?</h2>
  <p>GSE includes all vehicles and mechanical systems used on the ground to service aircraft between flights. From baggage carts and aircraft tugs to power units and deicing rigs, GSE keeps every airport moving.</p>

  <h2>Categories of GSE</h2>

  <h3>Non-Powered GSE</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Baggage Carts:</b> Transport passenger luggage between terminals and aircraft.</li>
    <li><b>Cargo Dollies:</b> Carry cargo containers and pallets.</li>
    <li><b>Towbars:</b> Connect aircraft to tugs for towing.</li>
    <li><b>Chocks and Cones:</b> Ensure aircraft remain safely in place during servicing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Powered GSE</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Aircraft Tugs & Tractors:</b> Move aircraft between gates and hangars.</li>
    <li><b>Ground Power Units (GPUs):</b> Provide electricity to parked aircraft.</li>
    <li><b>Deicing Equipment:</b> Clear snow and ice from aircraft surfaces.</li>
    <li><b>Belt Loaders:</b> Load and unload baggage and cargo.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why GSE Is Essential</h2>
  <p>Reliable GSE is crucial for operational efficiency, safety, and customer satisfaction. Fast, well-coordinated ground operations reduce turnaround times, minimize flight delays, and ensure compliance with strict aviation regulations.</p>

  <h2>Emerging Trends: Electric and Sustainable GSE</h2>
  <p>As airports move toward sustainability, electric GSE (eGSE) is becoming more common — offering lower emissions, quieter operations, and regulatory advantages. Rampvia actively helps clients source the latest electric and eco-friendly ground support solutions.</p>
